# Panel_Zone_Shell_Element_Model_OpenSees
In this repository, the FourNodeQuad2D3DOF element is shared.

This element was modified by Skiadopoulos and Lignos at EPFL. More details are found in https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eqe.3629

Both .cpp and .h file formats are included for one to integrate to the OpenSees environment.

An example is also provided that utilized the developed FourNodeQuad2D3DOF element: Interior_Subassembly_Shell_Panel_Example.tcl

In this example the highly inelastic panel zone is modeled with the developed element and the interior beam-to-column subassembly is imposed to cyclic symmetric loading protocol.
